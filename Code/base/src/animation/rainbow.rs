    /// * `duration` - The length of time this animation will run.
    /// * `rainbow_length` - The length of time it takes for the rainbow to fully cycle through all the LEDs.
    /// * `brightness` - The brightness value to use. Should be in range [0, 1].
    /// * `size` - The number of LEDs this animation will animate for.
    /// * `saturation` - The saturation to be used for all colors generated by HSV values.
    /// * `value` - The value to be used for all colors generated by HSV values.
    /// * `arc` - The amount of the arc between hue 0 and 360 (mapped to the range [0, 1] for this parameter) that is displayed across all the LEDs. NOTE: The arc can be larger than one, and can be as large as you like. For example an arc value of 2 would mean that there are 2 full rainbows visible across the LEDs.
    /// * `step` - The number of LEDs in a row that keep the same color before moving on to the next color. E.g if a step of 1 yields an LED array of \[1, 2, 3, 4\], then a step of 2 yields an array of \[1, 1, 2, 2\].
