//! # Draw
//!
//! This module contains the types that will "draw" to the LEDs.
//!
//! There are two drawers defined in this module, one being the actual drawer
//! that will draw the colors to physical LEDs connected to a Raspberry Pi, and
//! the second is an emulated LED setup that draws to "LEDs" on the terminal
//! with a configurable number of "LEDs" per row.
