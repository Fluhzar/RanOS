//! # Draw
//!
//! This crate contains the types that will "draw" to the LEDs.
//!
//! There are three drawers defined in this module, one being the actual drawer
//! that will draw the colors to physical LEDs connected to a Raspberry Pi,
//! the second is an emulated LED setup that draws to "LEDs" on the terminal
//! with a configurable number of "LEDs" per row, and the third being a drawer
//! that has no output, useful for debugging/testing purposes.
