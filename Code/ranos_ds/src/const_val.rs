//! ConstVal

/// This struct represents a value that is immutable, and cannot be changed
/// throughout its lifetime.
///
/// This type is more of a syntactic representation of intent rather than
/// forcing you to not change a value, as you could easily perform an operation
/// such as:
///
/// ```
/// # use ranos_ds::const_val::ConstVal;
/// let mut a = ConstVal::new(6);
/// a = ConstVal::new(a.unwrap() + 3);
/// ```
///
/// Thus there are no true protections against modification of the value, just
/// a way to show intent that a value won't be changed even in a context where
/// the owner is mutable.
