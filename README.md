# RanOS

A project and character embodying the creativity and expression desired for myself.

# Info

This repository is made up of many different sub-projects and tests, as well as some notes for planned video production in the future for the project. This section will break down the different areas of this repository individually.

## Code

This section contains all of the code (duh) that is used on this project. From a test of generating frames of LED animations, to testing the [Fastest Fourier Transform of the West](http://fftw.org) library, to the many different tests for creating different LED patterns and animations, to testing simple serial communication between the microcontroller and the host Raspberry Pi.

## Hardware

The hardware for this project is fairly extensive. The main computation will be done by a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/), running Ubuntu Server. Connected to the Raspberry Pi via USB is the [PJRC Teensy 4.0 Microcontroller](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html), which is driving the [APA102C-5050 RGB LEDs](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/APA102.pdf). Between the microcontroller and the LEDs is a breakout PCB for increased ease of overall project production. The breakout board was designed using [KiCad EDA](http://kicad-pcb.org/), and are produced through [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/).

## Notes

The Notes subdirectory contains a simple project outline that helps me organize my thoughts, even though it is quite an unorganized way to organize thoughts.... Further inside this subdirectory are talking points for a future video series I'm (loosely) planning on making to document the production progress of the RanOS project.

# About RanOS and Synths

[RanOS](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/32036759/), the character, is a Synth created by Fluhzar (that's me!)

Synths are a completely open species created by [Vader-San](https://twitter.com/VaderSan), and more info can be found [here](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/30498471)

More info can be found in the project outline found [here](Notes/ProjectOutline.md)
