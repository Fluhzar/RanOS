# RanOS

A project and character embodying the creativity and expression of myself.

## Info

This repository is undergoing an active change from a collection of random sub-projects and tests to a more organized development platform for the project.

## Code

The heart of RanOS is all of the code powering everything from input systems to procedural animations drawn on suit LEDs. This behavior is mostly encapsulated in the `core` sub-folder, but will be broken out into individual crates for ease of use.

## Hardware

The hardware for this project is fairly extensive. The main computation will be done by a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/). Connected to the Raspberry Pi via its GPIO pins are the [APA102C-5050 RGB LEDs](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/APA102.pdf) (may change later to the SK9822 clones depending on availability and feasibility). Between the Pi and the LEDs is a breakout PCB for increased ease of overall project production. The breakout board was designed using [KiCad EDA](http://kicad-pcb.org/), and test prints were produced through [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/).

## Notes

The Notes subdirectory contains a simple project outline that helps me organize my thoughts, even though it is quite an unorganized way to organize thoughts....

## About RanOS and Synths

[RanOS](https://refsheet.net/Fluhzar/ranos), the character, is a Synth created by Fluhzar (that's me!)

Synths are a completely open species created by [Vader-San](https://twitter.com/VaderSan), and more info can be found [here](https://www.furaffinity.net/view/30498471)

More info can be found in the project outline found [here](Notes/ProjectOutline.md)

## Thank You

It means the world to me that others would be interested enough to check out the work I do, so thank you.
